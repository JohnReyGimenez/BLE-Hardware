# BLE Attendance Hardware

This repository contains the firmware and hardware details for the **ESP32 and nRF52840 prototypes** of a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) attendance system.

This project is designed to automate attendance by assigning students a wearable **BLE Tag** (beacon) and using a network of **Classroom Scanners** to detect their presence. The scanners log entry/exit events, timestamp them, and forward them to a central backend server.

## System Architecture

The system consists of three main parts:

1.  **BLE Tag (nRF52840):** Beacon that continuously broadcasts its unique ID.
2.  **Classroom Scanner (Dual ESP32):** A two-part node that receives BLE signals and sends them to the network.
    * **ESP32-A (Scanner):** Scans for BLE broadcasts, filters for known tags, and adds an accurate timestamp (via an RTC Module).
    * **ESP32-B (Wi-Fi):** Receives data from ESP32-A via **ESP-NOW** and POSTs it (as JSON) to the backend API.
3.  **[Backend Server (Rails API)](https://github.com/JohnReyGimenez/BLE-Attendance-API):** A central server that receives the JSON data and records the attendance.

### Data Flow

`[nRF52840 Tag]` $\to$ `(BLE Broadcast)` $\to$ `[ESP32-A Scanner + RTC]` $\to$ `(ESP-NOW)` $\to$ `[ESP32-B Wi-Fi]` $\to$ `(HTTP POST)` $\to$ `[Rails API]`

## Firmware

This is a [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) project. All firmware source code is located in the `src/` directory.

* **`platformio.ini`**: The project configuration file. It defines the boards (nRF52840, ESP32), framework (Arduino), and all required libraries (e.g., BLE libraries, ESP-NOW, RTC, etc.).

* **`src/ble_tag_nrf52840.cpp` (BLE Tag):**
    * Firmware for the nRF52840 beacon.
    * It initializes the chip as a BLE server and periodically broadcasts an **iBeacon frame**.
    * This specific frame format allows scanners to efficiently identify the tag.

* **`src/esp32a_scanner.cpp` (Scanner Node):**
    * Firmware for the ESP32-A, which handles all real-time sensing.
    * Continuously scans for BLE advertisements.
    * Filters for the specific iBeacons broadcast by the tags.
    * Queries the DS3231 RTC for an accurate timestamp upon detection.
    * Sends the event data (tag ID, timestamp) to ESP32-B via ESP-NOW.

* **`src/esp32b_wifi.cpp` (Wi-Fi Node):**
    * Firmware for the ESP32-B, which handles all network communication.
    * Receives data packets from ESP32-A via ESP-NOW.
    * Connects to the local Wi-Fi network.
    * Formats the data as a JSON payload and sends it to the Rails API via an HTTP POST request.
